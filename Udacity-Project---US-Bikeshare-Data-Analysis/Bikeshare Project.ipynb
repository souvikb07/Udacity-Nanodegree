    "## Introduction\n",
    "Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC."
